I am putting a prompt for a website i want below here i want this to be built by django backend react frontend and a very well functional app or web service i want to sell this so study your work and make it scabable 
prompt is here: A little something: For the Mag 7 stocks and the three indices I watch (SPY, QQQ, IWM), it would be cool to have the app be able to assess those names on a daily basis, combined with past/historical price movement, and be notified or something when one of those names has been trading at or below their ATR (Average Trading Range) for at least 3-4 straight days up to a week. 

When these names do this tighter price action for a sustained amount of time, there is usually a large move that occurs after the fact (like a ‘breakout’). Most of the time during these tighter days one after another, their volume is lower but what usually happens is the volume increases substantially a day or two before the big move while maintaining that tight, lower than normal, ATR. The best/highest quality trades coincide with these setups occurring. So, it would be huge to have a program or something that keeps track of that data and alerts you or something when all of those points act in congruence.
